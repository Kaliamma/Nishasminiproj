      <h3 id="headline">About:</h3>
      <li>
      She was born into a middle-class educated family in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She went to the Convent of Jesus and Mary in Karachi. Later she went to London to earn a degree in arts and returned to Pakistan. She realized that women in the Pakistani society were not able to get equality in the society so she started a movement called 'Tehrik-e-Niswan' (Women's Movement) and raised her voice for their rights, health issues, education and equality</li>
      <li>Sheema was born the second of three children. Sheema has an elder brother and a younger sister. Her early education was in the convent schools of the cantonments where her father would be posted. Because of the frequent and many postings all over the country, they as children managed to see most of Pakistan, and because her grandparents were in India they used to travel by train every summer holidays and visit them there. So they had a great exposure to both India and Pakistan.

It was their early exposure to Indian classical dance and music that they had on their visits to Hyderabad, and to Western classical music of which her father was very fond of, that stirred her interest in the arts. As a young girl Sheema had studied Western classical music and read all the classical literature that was available. Her parents also gave them a wonderful exposure to the world of dance, drama and music.

They travelled all over Pakistan as well as around the globe and visited museums and art galleries and saw the best of performances in Europe and UK - she remembers watching a ballet performance with Rudolph Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn and seeing Laurence Oliver and Maggie Smith on stage. All of this was part of their education and upbringing.

Sheema is a Marxist and a feminist. She believes in the Marxist ideology and a vision of a classless society where men and women hold an equal status.

However, Sheema believes that feminism is recognition of the existence of sexism, male domination and patriarchy and the desire to change this situation. She considers herself an activist of human rights issues and strongly feels that she must do whatever she can to change this discrimination against women in their society so that [the woman] can find her place of dignity and respect. It is the values that have to change and the attitudes towards women both of society and state.

Classical dance was banned in Pakistan by President General Zia ul Haq in 1983. Ever since then it has been very difficult to perform and to exist as a dancer in Pakistan.</li>

<li>Sheema was recently at a party where she overheard a lady saying to the other about her, 
<br>'Do not sit next to her, she is a dancer'. Often she has stepped out dressed for a performance and looked around to see if someone is there to shoot or attack her.</li>	
      <li>Also, appeared at the shrine of Sehwan Sharif after the barbaric suicide attack and performed dhamal (a Sufi dance form). She gave a passionate performance and told the media that nobody can stop music and dance.She performed at the Faiz Aman Mela, Lahore where she paid a tribute to Asma Jahangir. She said we can bring peace, harmony and equality by loving each other and by sharing the message of love with each other.</li>
      
      <li>She made her Dubai debut in 2014 with a concert celebrating the work of literary figures from India and Pakistan.
		She, who has mastered several Indian classical dance forms including Kathak, Bharatanatyam and Odissi. She had formed Tehrik-e-Â­Niswan in 1979, an organisation that spreads awareness about women empowerment through music and dance.</li>
